## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes applied to the alerts system across all dashboards to resolve the internal server errors and authorization issues.

## Key Issues Fixed

- **Fix**: Updated user ID extraction to handle different auth providers (id, uid, sub fields)
- **Affected Dashboards**: Admin, Parent, Authority

### 2. Data Structure Mismatches
- **Problem**: Form data structure didn't match the database structure causing internal server errors
- **Fix**: Updated form fields and API handling to match the existing database structure
- **Affected Dashboards**: All dashboards with alert creation/editing

### 3. Duplicate Variable Definitions
- **Problem**: Compilation errors due to duplicate variable definitions in the API route
- **Fix**: Removed redundant child data retrieval in the alerts API
- **Affected Dashboards**: All dashboards using the alerts API

### 4. Missing Form Fields
- **Problem**: Form was missing fields required by the database structure
- **Fix**: Added date, time, and other required fields to the form
- **Affected Dashboards**: Parent dashboard report page, Admin dashboard create alert page
