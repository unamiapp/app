# Alerts Stats Solution

## Issue Fixed
The active alerts stats were showing 0 alerts across dashboards even when alerts were successfully created.

## Solution
1. Updated the DashboardStats component to directly fetch and count active alerts
2. Enhanced the ActiveAlertsDashboard component to properly filter for active alerts
3. Improved the alert utils to ensure proper normalization of alert data
4. Added case-insensitive matching for alert status values

## Technical Details
- The DashboardStats component now fetches alerts directly from the debug API
- Alert status filtering is now case-insensitive (accepts 'active', 'Active', or undefined)
- Added detailed logging to help debug alert count issues
- Ensured alert normalization sets a default 'active' status if missing

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. Case sensitivity in the status field filtering ('active' vs 'Active')
2. Some alerts not having a status field set
3. Inconsistent alert data structures between admin and parent dashboards

## Testing
The solution has been tested and confirmed to:
1. Correctly count and display active alerts in the dashboard stats
2. Show active alerts in the ActiveAlertsDashboard component
3. Work consistently across both admin and parent dashboards

## Implementation
The fix was implemented by:
1. Rewriting the DashboardStats component to include active alerts count fetching
2. Updating the ActiveAlertsDashboard component to use case-insensitive filtering
3. Enhancing the alert utils to ensure proper normalization
4. Adding detailed logging to help debug any remaining issues
