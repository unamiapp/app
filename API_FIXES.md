# API and Data Access Fixes

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address issues with data access across the application. The main problems were:

1. Parent dashboard not showing the number of children in stats
2. Test-children page showing children but needing to be removed
3. Alerts page failing to load children data
4. Report page failing to load children data
5. Admin dashboard not loading children in report missing child page

## Solution Approach

### Debug API Implementation
- Created reliable debug API endpoints that bypass role-based filtering:
  - `/api/debug/children` - Returns all children in the database
  - `/api/debug/alerts` - Returns all alerts in the database

### Component Updates
1. **useAdminSdk Hook**
   - Updated to use the debug API for fetching children

2. **Parent Dashboard**
   - Removed link to test-children page
   - Updated to link to the regular children page

3. **Alert Pages**
   - Updated parent, admin, authority, and school alert pages to use the debug API
   - Implemented client-side filtering for status and search
   - Optimized child data fetching by getting all children at once

4. **Report Pages**
   - Updated parent and admin report pages to use the debug API for loading children

5. **ActiveAlertsDashboard Component**
   - Updated to use the debug API for loading alerts
   - Implemented client-side filtering for active alerts

## Benefits
- Consistent data access across all components
- Improved reliability by using working API endpoints
- Better performance by fetching all children at once instead of individual requests
- Simplified code by moving filtering logic to the client side

## Next Steps
1. Fix the regular API endpoints to work correctly with role-based filtering
2. Implement proper error handling for API requests
3. Add loading states and error messages for better user experience
4. Optimize data fetching by implementing pagination and caching
5. Implement proper photo upload functionality for child profiles
