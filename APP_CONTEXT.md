# UNCIP App Context for Production Rollout

## Current Status Overview

### Working Components
- Parent dashboard navigation
- Admin users page with full CRUD
- Firebase Admin SDK centralized in admin.ts
- Alerts system with full CRUD functionality
- Debug API endpoints for reliable data access

### Partially Working Components
- Children page (read only via debug API)
- Firebase Storage integration

### Non-Working Components
- Children page edit/update functionality
- Children page delete functionality
- Photo upload for child profiles
- Geofencing features

## CRUD Operations Status

### Children Management
- **Create**: Exists in code but not integrated in test page
- **Read**: Working in test page via direct API call
- **Update**: Not implemented in test page, exists in original code
- **Delete**: Not implemented in test page, exists in original code

### User Management
- **Create**: Working in admin dashboard
- **Read**: Working in admin dashboard
- **Update**: Working in admin dashboard
- **Delete**: Working in admin dashboard

### Alerts Management
- **Create**: Working for admin, parent, and authority users
- **Read**: Working with proper filtering and search for all user roles (admin, parent, authority, school)
- **Update**: Working with status changes (resolve, cancel)
- **Delete**: Working for admin users only

## Critical Components for Production

### Photo Upload System
- Essential for child identification
- Currently broken due to Firebase Storage conflicts
- Needs direct API implementation similar to working test page

### Child Profile Pages
- Need complete CRUD operations
- Should follow the same pattern as working test page
- Must integrate with photo upload system

### Firebase Admin SDK
- Centralized in admin.ts
- admin-direct.ts now imports from admin.ts to prevent conflicts
- All API routes should use the centralized SDK

## Integration Requirements

### Alerts System
- ✅ Integrated with child profiles
- ✅ Using consistent API pattern
- ✅ Using centralized Firebase Admin SDK
- ✅ Alerts are properly displayed in dashboards
- ✅ Alerts can be created, viewed, and managed

### Geofencing
- Requires location services
- Must integrate with alerts system
- Needs real-time database capabilities

## Technical Approach
- Use direct API calls pattern that works in test page
- Avoid complex hooks that cause conflicts
- Centralize all Firebase service access
- Implement consistent error handling and state management
