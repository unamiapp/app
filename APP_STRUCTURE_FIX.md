# App Structure Fix

## Issue Fixed
The application was experiencing a build error due to conflicting routing structures between the Pages Router (`/src/pages`) and the App Router (`/src/app`). Specifically, the following conflict was detected:

```
Conflicting app and page file was found, please remove the conflicting files to continue:
  "src/pages/dashboard/parent/children/index.tsx" - "src/app/dashboard/parent/children/page.tsx"
```

## Solution
1. Removed the conflicting file in the Pages Router (`/src/pages/dashboard/parent/children/index.tsx`)
2. Cleaned up empty directories in the Pages Router to prevent future conflicts

## App Structure
This application is using Next.js App Router (`/src/app`) for its routing structure. The Pages Router (`/src/pages`) should not be used simultaneously for the same routes as it causes conflicts.

### Current Structure
- `/src/app/dashboard/parent/children/page.tsx` - The main children page component
- `/src/app/dashboard/parent/children/add/page.tsx` - Add child page
- `/src/app/dashboard/parent/children/edit/[id]/page.tsx` - Edit child page

## Recommendations
1. **Use App Router Consistently**: Continue using the App Router (`/src/app`) for all new routes and components
2. **Remove Pages Router Files**: If any other files exist in the Pages Router (`/src/pages`) that conflict with the App Router, they should be removed
3. **Migration Strategy**: If you need to migrate from Pages Router to App Router, do so completely for each route to avoid conflicts

## Technical Details
Next.js 13+ supports both routing systems but doesn't allow the same route to be defined in both systems. The App Router is the newer and recommended approach, offering features like:
- Server Components
- Nested Layouts
- Loading UI
- Error Handling

By removing the conflicting file, we've ensured that the application uses only one routing system for the children page, resolving the build error.
