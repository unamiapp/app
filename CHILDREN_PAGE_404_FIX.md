# Children Page 404 Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **Removed Duplicate Files**
   - Removed `page.js` that was causing duplicate page warnings
   - Removed `index.tsx` that was conflicting with `page.tsx`

2. **Simplified API Calls**
   - Simplified data fetching to use only the debug API
   - Removed complex fallback logic that could cause issues
   - Streamlined error handling

3. **Added Direct Routes**
   - Created `/parent-children` route that redirects to the children page
   - Added Pages Router compatibility with `/src/pages/dashboard/parent/children`

## Technical Details

- Using App Router's `page.tsx` as the single source of truth
- Simplified API calls to reduce complexity
- Added multiple routing options to ensure the page is accessible

## Verification

The children page should now be accessible via:
- `/dashboard/parent/children` (main route)
- `/parent-children` (shortcut route)
- Left panel navigation link
