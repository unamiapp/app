# Children Page Fix

## Issue
The parent dashboard children page was not displaying correctly (404 error), while the test page was working fine.

## Root Cause
The issue was with the useChildren hook and how it was interacting with the Firebase Admin SDK. Multiple initializations of the Firebase Admin SDK in different files were causing conflicts.

## Solution
1. Simplified the children page to fetch data directly from the API instead of using the useChildren hook
2. Disabled the admin-direct.ts file to prevent conflicts with the main admin.ts file
3. Modified the children API route to use the centralized admin SDK
4. Added a debug API endpoint to directly access the Firestore database

## Implementation
- The children page now uses a simple fetch call to get data from the debug API
- The delete functionality uses fetch API directly instead of the hook
- The admin-direct.ts file now imports from the main admin.ts file instead of initializing its own instance

## Testing
1. The test page at /dashboard/parent/children-test works correctly
2. The regular children page at /dashboard/parent/children should now work correctly as well

## Next Steps
1. Once confirmed working, consider refactoring the useChildren hook to be more reliable
2. Clean up any unnecessary debug code
3. Ensure all Firebase Admin SDK initializations are centralized
