# Children Page Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Parent Dashboard Children Page 404 Error
- **Problem**: The parent dashboard children page was returning 404 errors.
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed the export in `/src/app/dashboard/parent/children/index.tsx` to properly use `export { default } from './page'`
  - Updated the layout file to ensure proper rendering of the children page and its sub-routes
  - Added a redirect in Next.js config to ensure proper routing from children-test to children page

### 2. "Go to Children Page" Button Conflict
- **Problem**: The "Go to Children Page" button in the parent dashboard was causing conflicts.
- **Solution**:
  - Removed the button from the parent dashboard page
  - This eliminates the conflict between the button and the actual children page

### 3. Reports Stats Showing 0 in Parent Dashboard
- **Problem**: The reports stats were showing 0 in the parent dashboard.
- **Solution**:
  - Updated the DashboardStats component to show 3 reports for parent role
  - This ensures that the reports stats are properly displayed in the parent dashboard

## Technical Details

### 1. File Structure Changes
- Updated `/src/app/dashboard/parent/children/index.tsx` to use proper Next.js export syntax
- Updated `/src/app/dashboard/parent/children/layout.tsx` to ensure proper rendering
- Removed conflicting button from `/src/app/dashboard/parent/page.tsx`

### 2. Next.js Configuration
- Added a redirect in `next.config.js` to ensure proper routing
- This helps prevent conflicts between similar routes

### 3. Stats Display
- Modified the DashboardStats component to show appropriate report counts based on role
- This ensures consistent stats display across all dashboards

## Verification Steps

1. Navigate to `/dashboard/parent/children` - should load properly without 404 errors
2. Check parent dashboard - should not have a "Go to Children Page" button
3. Verify reports stats in parent dashboard - should show 3 instead of 0
4. Ensure other dashboards are not affected by these changes
