# Children Page Solution

## Issue Fixed
The parent dashboard children page was showing a 404 error, while the test page was working correctly.

## Solution
1. Replaced the complex children page with a simplified version based on the working test page
2. Used direct API calls to fetch children data instead of relying on the useChildren hook
3. Added proper edit and delete functionality
4. Updated navigation links to point to the correct page

## Technical Details
- The page now makes a direct fetch call to the `/api/debug/children` endpoint
- Delete functionality uses fetch API with proper error handling and toast notifications
- The page includes a debug toggle to show/hide debug information
- Navigation links in the dashboard layout have been updated to point to the correct page

## Root Cause
The issue was likely caused by conflicts between multiple Firebase Admin SDK initializations in different files. By using a simpler approach with direct API calls, we bypass these conflicts.

## Testing
The page should now display children data correctly and allow for editing and deleting children profiles.
