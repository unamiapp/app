# Parent Children Page Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Removed Duplicate Files
- Removed `/src/app/dashboard/parent/children/index.tsx` that was causing duplicate rendering
- Removed unused `/src/app/auth-provider.tsx` that was causing context provider conflicts
- Removed unused `/src/app/providers.tsx` that was not being used but could cause conflicts

### 2. Fixed Parent-Child Filtering
- Updated the children page to filter by the current parent's ID
- Added proper parent ID filtering to the API call
- Ensured the delete handler maintains the parent filter when refreshing the list

### 3. Resolved Context Provider Conflicts
- Eliminated duplicate context providers that were causing React warnings
- Ensured only one instance of each provider is rendered

## Technical Details

The main issues were:

1. **Duplicate Files**: Having both `index.tsx` and `page.tsx` in the same directory was causing Next.js to render the same component twice, leading to duplicate context providers.

2. **Unused Provider Files**: Multiple provider files were present in the codebase, potentially causing conflicts even if not directly used.

3. **Missing Parent Filtering**: The children page was not properly filtering children by the parent's ID, causing either no children to be shown or all children in the system to be displayed.

## Verification

The children page should now be accessible via:
- `/dashboard/parent/children` (main route)
- Each parent will only see their own children
- All CRUD operations maintain proper parent-child relationships
- No more React context provider warnings in the console
