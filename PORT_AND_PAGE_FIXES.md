# Port Conflict and Page 404 Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Port Conflict (EADDRINUSE)
The application was failing to start because port 3000 was already in use. This is a common issue in development environments, especially in containerized environments like GitHub Codespaces.

**Solutions implemented:**

1. Created a `find-port.js` script that:
   - Attempts to find an available port starting from 3000
   - Automatically increments until it finds an open port
   - Starts the Next.js server on the available port

2. Added utility scripts to package.json:
   - `kill-port`: Kills any processes using port 3000
   - `dev:clean`: Kills processes on port 3000 and then starts the server on an available port

### 2. Parent Children Page 404 Error
The parent dashboard children page was showing a 404 error due to incomplete HTML structure and potential issues with data fetching.

**Solutions implemented:**

1. Fixed the incomplete HTML structure:
   - Properly closed all HTML tags
   - Ensured correct nesting of components

2. Added explicit data fetching on component mount:
   - Added useEffect hook to fetch children data when the component mounts
   - Added console logging for better debugging

## How to Use

1. To start the server on an available port:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. If you encounter port conflicts, kill processes on port 3000 and start fresh:
   ```
   npm run dev:clean
   ```

3. To only kill processes on port 3000:
   ```
   npm run kill-port
   ```

## Technical Details

- The port finder uses Node.js net module to test port availability
- The children page now properly fetches data on mount and has complete HTML structure
- Console logging has been added to help diagnose any remaining issues
