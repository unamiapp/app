# UNCIP App - Project Status for Production Rollout

## Current Status Overview

### Working Components
- Admin dashboard with full functionality
- Alert creation and management in admin dashboard
- User management in admin dashboard
- Authority dashboard profile upload
- Debug API endpoints for reliable data access

### Partially Working Components
- Parent dashboard navigation
- Alert creation in parent dashboard (fixed with dedicated endpoint)
- Alert stats display (fixed with proper filtering)

### Non-Working Components
- Children page in parent dashboard (404 error)
- Photo upload for child profiles
- Child profile creation and management

## Issue Analysis

### 1. Children Page 404 Error

**Root Cause:**
- The parent dashboard children page is experiencing 404 errors due to conflicts in Firebase Admin SDK initialization.
- Multiple instances of the Firebase Admin SDK are being initialized in different files, causing authentication conflicts.

**Solution:**
- The children page should use the debug API endpoint directly instead of the useChildren hook.
- The debug API endpoint at `/api/debug/children` is working correctly and should be used for all children-related operations.
- The useChildren hook should be refactored to use the debug API endpoint consistently.

### 2. Photo Upload Not Working

**Root Cause:**
- Firebase Storage rules are not properly configured for client-side access.
- The useStorage hook is attempting to access Firebase Storage directly from the client, which is failing due to permission issues.
- The storage.rules file has a mismatch between the role-based access control and the actual user roles.

**Solution:**
- Use the debug API endpoint at `/api/debug/upload` for all photo uploads.
- Update the PhotoUpload component to use the debug API endpoint consistently.
- Ensure the ChildProfileForm component uses the PhotoUpload component correctly.
- Update Firebase Storage rules to allow server-side access only.

### 3. Authentication Issues

**Root Cause:**
- The Firebase Admin SDK is being initialized multiple times in different files.
- The admin-direct.ts file was previously initializing its own instance of the Firebase Admin SDK.
- Role-based access control is not consistently implemented across the application.

**Solution:**
- Ensure all API routes use the centralized Firebase Admin SDK from admin.ts.
- Update the admin-direct.ts file to import from admin.ts (already done).
- Implement consistent role-based access control across all API routes.
- Use the debug API endpoints for reliable data access.

### 4. Firebase Rules

**Root Cause:**
- The Firebase Storage rules are using request.auth.token.role for role checking, but the actual user roles are stored in Firestore.
- The Firestore rules are correctly implemented but may not be deployed.

**Solution:**
- Update the Firebase Storage rules to use the same role checking mechanism as the Firestore rules.
- Deploy the updated rules to Firebase.
- Ensure all API routes use the centralized Firebase Admin SDK for consistent authentication.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Fix Children Page

1. Update the parent dashboard children page to use the debug API endpoint directly.
2. Ensure the ChildProfileForm component uses the debug API endpoint for all operations.
3. Update the add child page to use the debug API endpoint for child creation.
4. Test the children page functionality to ensure it works correctly.

### 2. Fix Photo Upload

1. Update the PhotoUpload component to use the debug API endpoint consistently.
2. Ensure the ChildProfileForm component uses the PhotoUpload component correctly.
3. Update the add child page to use the debug API endpoint for photo uploads.
4. Test the photo upload functionality to ensure it works correctly.

### 3. Fix Authentication Issues

1. Ensure all API routes use the centralized Firebase Admin SDK from admin.ts.
2. Update any remaining code that uses direct Firebase access to use the debug API endpoints.
3. Implement consistent role-based access control across all API routes.
4. Test authentication across all dashboards to ensure it works correctly.

### 4. Update Firebase Rules

1. Update the Firebase Storage rules to use the same role checking mechanism as the Firestore rules.
2. Deploy the updated rules to Firebase.
3. Test the rules to ensure they work correctly.

## Testing Plan

### 1. Children Page Testing

1. Navigate to the parent dashboard children page.
2. Verify that the children list loads correctly.
3. Create a new child profile and verify it appears in the list.
4. Edit an existing child profile and verify the changes are saved.
5. Delete a child profile and verify it is removed from the list.

### 2. Photo Upload Testing

1. Create a new child profile with a photo.
2. Verify that the photo uploads successfully.
3. Edit an existing child profile and change the photo.
4. Verify that the photo updates correctly.
5. Remove a photo and verify it is deleted from storage.

### 3. Authentication Testing

1. Log in as an admin user and verify access to all dashboards.
2. Switch roles and verify the appropriate dashboard loads.
3. Test role-based access control by attempting to access restricted pages.
4. Verify that API routes enforce proper authentication.
